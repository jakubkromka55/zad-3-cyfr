<h2 id="definition-of-a-laptop">Definition of a Laptop</h2>
<p>A laptop computer, also known as a notebook computer, is a small, portable personal computer (PC) designed for mobile use. It typically features a clamshell design with a screen on the inside of the upper lid and a keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. Most laptops house their internal hardware components beneath the keyboard in the lower lid, and many modern models come with built-in webcams or even touchscreen displays. Unlike tablets, which usually run mobile operating systems, laptops typically operate on desktop operating systems developed for traditional PCs. More details can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The term &quot;laptop&quot; originates from its practical design, allowing the device to be used comfortably on a user&#39;s lap. &quot;Notebook&quot; is another common term, originally used to describe laptops that were more compact and lighter than their contemporaries. Over time, these terms have become interchangeable, particularly in American English, while their usage may vary in other English dialects.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-laptops">Types of Laptops</h2>
<p>Laptops have evolved into various types to suit different needs. <strong>Ultrabooks</strong>, for example, are ultra-thin and lightweight laptops that emphasize portability without compromising performance. These devices are ideal for professionals who value mobility and sleek design.</p>
<p>Another category is <strong>gaming laptops</strong>, which are specifically built for high-performance gaming. These devices are equipped with powerful processors and dedicated graphics cards, making them suitable for running resource-intensive applications and games.</p>
<p>There are also <strong>2-in-1 laptops</strong>, which combine the features of laptops and tablets. These devices often have detachable or foldable keyboards, enabling versatile usage in &quot;laptop mode&quot; or &quot;tablet mode,&quot; depending on the task at hand.</p>
